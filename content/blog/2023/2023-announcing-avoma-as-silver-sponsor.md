Avoma is a revenue intelligence company that helps customer-facing teams capture important customer information, before, during, and after important meetings. Its AI-powered technology automatically records all meetings, generates transcripts and summarized notes, and provides actionable insights that can be synced directly to CRM. This helps teams shorten sales cycles, delight more customers, and improve their overall performance.

Avoma was founded in 2017 by a team of experienced engineers and product managers who were frustrated with the way meetings were run in their previous jobs. They believe that meetings should be a productive and efficient way to collaborate and make decisions, and they set out to build a product that would make that happen.
